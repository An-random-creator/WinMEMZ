Your computer just executed a trojan by the name of WinMEMZ.
And you won't get your normal PC back!

>:]

Trying to kill WinMEMZ would cause your PC to automanically get destroyed, I wouldn't recommend doing this.

If you call a support person, give them this info:
Stop-code: FUCKED-BY-WINMEMZ.

Your MBR has been NyanCat'd anyways. Better enjoy the Nyan Cat! :3
